Online Grocery Store

Our online grocery store project brings together the strengths of different technologies to create a great shopping experience. 
We use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the parts you see on the website which is known as front end technologies and Python, Django, and MySQL behind the scenes which is known as backend
technologies . 
This combination lets users easily browse, choose, and buy groceries online. Django helps us manage user accounts, the products we have, and the safe payment process. Overall, it's a
smooth and modern way to shop for groceries on the internet.
